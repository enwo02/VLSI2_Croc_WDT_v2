\section{Overview of existing watchdog timer implementation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item State several possible watchdog implementations, with sources.
  \item Explain that it is possible to keep it really simple or to complicate
    it by adding some features, like having a log to know why the watchdog triggered.
\end{itemize}

\section{Justification for our approach}
Now, explain our choice to keep it small, simple, energy efficient easy to understand
and easy to "take over" if it is needed for something else.
Explain that the trade off gains in robustness of croc vs complication of watch dog is
the best by keeping the watchdog simple.
