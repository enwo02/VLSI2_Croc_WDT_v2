\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}

\section{Overview of the Croc SoC and its open-source nature}
\begin{itemize}
  \item{Picture of Croc SoC}
  \item{Quick explanation of its main parts and mostly what we are using ==> user_domain}
  \item{Mention that it is open-source and the importance of this, but also why it has to be robust for it to be competitive with closed source in real life scenarios}
\end{itemize}
\section{Why a watchdog timer (WDT) was needed}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Real life scenario as an example of anoying stuck in a loop chip (if possible, true historic reference)
  \item Explain what is a watchdog timer and how it would prevent this
  \item From this go on and conclude it was needed on the Croc SoC
\end{itemize}

\section{Goals and expected improvements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Emphasize on the main goals of the watchdog, with bullet points if possible to emphasize even more. THe main goals being: improve robustness while keeping area and throughput as low as possible. (should we add more goals?)
\end{itemize}
