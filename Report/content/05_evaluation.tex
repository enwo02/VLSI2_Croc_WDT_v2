\chapter{Evaluation}

\section{Simulation results}
Our watchdog passed all our simulations: from  the chip ggetting stuck in an infinit loop to TODO FIND OTHERS SIMULATION TESTS 

\section{Performance comparison (goal achieved?)}
Our goal was awchieved: we cna successfully say that we managed to improve the reliability and robustness of croc by adding a small area and power. 
We also managed to store and print our names in a ROM stored in useer domain.

\section{Possible improvements}
A lot of improvements can be done, but all depend of the possible application and of the willingness to trade off simlicity, area, power for something else like debugging ability. 
TODO: explain more
